Accelerating the Auction Algorithm on a FPGA
=======================

![status-badge](https://github.com/erlingrj/auction-accelerator/workflows/Continuous%Integration/badge.svg)


This repo contains RTL for a parameterizable FPGA accelerator for the Auction Algorithm.
It uses fpga-tidbits heavily and is written in Chisel3. Can be simulated in Verilator or deployed to a Zedboard.
